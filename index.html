                        <p1>Lee Alexander McQueen was born on March 17, 1969 in Lewisham, London to a working class family. His father was a taxi driver while his mother was a teacher. </p1><br></br>
                        <p1>McQueen had five siblings, with him being the youngest. He was close to his three sisters and his aunt. He was a self-described "pink sheep" of the family - a misfit but not a reject.</p1>

                        <p1>McQueen, who was called "Lee" by his friends, had already expressed early on that he had wanted to be a fashion designer. He dropped out of school when he was 16 to train at Savile Row at Gieves & Hawkes, a bespoke men's tailor and menswear line. There, he reportedly once embroidered a suit for the Prince of Wales with the words "I am a cunt" in the lining.</p1><br></br>
                        <p1>McQueen was also an avid scuba diver and had used this passion of his as an inspiration for some of his works, most notably for his Spring/Summer collection for 2010.</p1><br></br>

                        <p1>McQueen was openly gay and was already aware of his sexuality at the age of six. He once expressed that, <em>"I was sure of myself and my sexuality and I've got nothing to hide. I went straight from my mother's womb onto the gay parade." </em> He, however, only came out to his family when he was eighteen, and after an initially rough period, they were able to accept him completely.</p1><br></br>
                        <p1>In 2000, he married his partner George Forsyth in an unofficial ceremony in Ibiza as same-sex marriage was not yet legal in Spain at that time. However, the marriage lasted only for a year.</p1>
